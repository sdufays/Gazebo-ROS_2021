# AI_tests

Divers codes & notebooks de tests IA.

Use n_samples = 500 for testing the code. n_samples = 50000 for real training.

1_3D_Base_Classification_V1 : Program where we create and train a simple neural network without the use of transfer learning.
2_3D_Transfer_Learning_V1 : We use DenseNet201 as a base model to do transfer learning and train a neural network with a higher generalization capacity than our basic network.
3_Use_Trained_Model_V1 : Basic program with the necessary tools to use previously trained models.
4_Add_New_Object_V1 : In this program we train a model to detect 3 different classes of objects and use transfer learning to add a 4th object.
